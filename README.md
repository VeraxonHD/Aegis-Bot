## AEGIS
**A Discord Bot, written in javascript with node.js and the Discord.JS library**
##
What started off as a quick YouTube series turned into a 70% feature complete rewrite of [Shade](https://github.com/veraxonhd/shade-modbot)...

This bot contains a much more modular feel, and comes complete with a database full of statistics and data on users, such as message counts, warnings,
advanced log systems and much more.
