# Configuring your Aegis Settings

Each server has a unique configuration file, enabling you to change how some of the commands and logging features work.

Find the configuration variable (convar) you wish to change from the sidebar, and then follow the instructions to successfully edit your config!

# Getting help in-chat

You can use the command `a!help configure` to get help on the configuration of all of the convars.
