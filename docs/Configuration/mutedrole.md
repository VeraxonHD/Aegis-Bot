# Mute Role
> The Role that a user is given when they are targeted by the `a!mute` command.

## Default
The Default Muted Role is simply a role named "muted". This is automatically converted to lower case, so role names such as "MuTeD" and "MUtED" are both valid.

## Configuring Muted Role

Using the config command `a!configure`, you can change the role that the user is given when muted.

### Usage:

`a!configure mutedrole <@Role>` or `a!cfg -mr <@Role>` 

<p class="tip">Make sure to <em>@Mention</em> the Role! Don't use its ID.</p>
